<div class="para">Think of some examples of variables  youâ€™ve seen in other math classes. What do these variables represent? Probably, the first example that comes to mind is something from an algebra class, such as <span class="process-math">\(y=x^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=3x+2\text{.}\)</span> You may also think of examples such as solving for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in an expression such as <span class="process-math">\(x^2=4\text{.}\)</span> We use variables in mathematical statements to represent quantities that can vary. But we also use them to be more precise. Think of how much more confusing the first statement would be if we had to write it as "a number squared equals another number;" or the second statement, "the function which multiplies a number by 3 and adds 2." When you first learned varables, you probably WERE introduced to them in terms of sentences, but eventually, you got used to what the symbols mean.</div>
