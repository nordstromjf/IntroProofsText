<div class="para">Some proof writing advice:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Make the proof self-contained. Try not to reference many other mathematical facts. Many proofs in this course will rely entirely on definitions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use complete sentences. Even equations have a sentence structure. Your proof should be able to be read in sentences.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Give reasons. Connect your statements together.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Include words. Often using a word is better that using a symbol. Many proofs have no symbols in them at all.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The audience for your proofs is not the instructor. Think of the audience as being your peers in the course or even yourself in a few weeks (or months) when you might have forgotten the specific content. Write so you will know what you meant later.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The goal of a proof is to write a clear, easy to follow argument--not to just get to the end. The “answer” is the proof itself. Use space, start a new line, set equations on their own line.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Never feel that you have to be able to know what the end of the proof will look like before you can start. Write proofs  one step at a time. Start with what you know. See if you can do one thing. See if you can do another thing. Look at where you want to go. Do not try to see the whole picture at once. This is also good advice for reading a proof.</div></li>
