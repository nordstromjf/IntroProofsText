<div class="para">Never feel that you have to be able to know what the end of the proof will look like before you can start. Write proofs  one step at a time. Start with what you know. See if you can do one thing. See if you can do another thing. Look at where you want to go. Do not try to see the whole picture at once. This is also good advice for reading a proof.</div>
