<div class="para">Note, in the base step we looked at each side of what we wanted to show separately. We can refer to this as a “left hand side/ right hand side proof”, or in short hand, a LHS/RHS proof. If we just start with the equation we want to show, then we are assuming what we are trying to prove. To avoid this, it is best, when trying to show two things are equal in the base step, to do a LHS/ RHS proof.</div>
