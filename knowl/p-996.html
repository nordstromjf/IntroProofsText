<div class="para">Our next example applies induction to a statement involving inequalities. Inequality induction proofs will be more challenging as they often take a bit more trial and error in the scratchwork. When dealing with <em class="emphasis">equalities</em>, you know for example, that you have to add the same thing to both sides. However, with <em class="emphasis">inequalities</em> you can change one side as long as you maintain the inequality. For example, if you know <span class="process-math">\(P&gt;Q\text{,}\)</span> then you also know <span class="process-math">\(P+2&gt;Q\text{.}\)</span> The fact that we can change one side of the expression makes it less intuitive to see what steps to take.</div>
