  <title>Proof by Contradiction and Contrapositive</title><idx><h>contradiction</h><h>proof by</h></idx><idx><h>contrapositive</h><h>proof by</h></idx>

  <introduction><p>In this section we will learn two new proof techniques, contradiction and contrapositive. Both proof techniques rely on being able to negate mathematical statements.</p>

<p>As we add more proof techniques, it is important to realize that you are not expected to know which technique to use when you start a proof. Proof-writing often takes some trial and error. First try a direct proof, if you get stuck, you may think about whether breaking your set into cases will  help, or whether negating a statement will make it easier to use. It is also quite possible that different methods can be used to prove the same statement.</p></introduction>

<subsection xml:id="SS_contradiction"><title>Proof by Contradiction</title><idx><h>contradiction</h><h>proof by</h></idx>
  
  <p>The basic idea behind proof by contradiction is that if you assume the statement you want to prove is false, and this forces a logical contradiction, then you must have been wrong to start. Thus, you can conclude the original statement was true. By a logical contradiction, we generally mean a statement that must be both true and false at the same time. When writing a proof by contradiction you must be very careful in your logical reasoning. It must be clear that you reach a contradiction though careful logical deduction.</p>

<p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Assume the statement to be proved is false. Or, assume the negation of the statement is true.</p></li>
  <li><p>Show you reach some logical contradiction. This means you have a statement in your proof that must be both true and false.</p></li>
  <li><p>Conclude the original statement is true.</p></li>
  
</ul></p>
</assemblage>



<p>Since contradiction relies on negating statements, recall the following negations from <xref ref="connectives"/>:
<ul>
  <li><m>p\rightarrow q</m> has negation <m>p\ \wedge \neg q</m></li>
  <li><m>p\ \wedge q</m> has negation <m>\neg p\ \vee \neg q</m></li>
  <li><m>p\ \vee q</m> has negation <m>\neg p\ \wedge \neg q</m></li>
</ul>
</p>

<example xml:id="E_contradiction"><title>Proof by Contradiction</title>
<p>Prove if <m>x^2+y=13</m> and <m>y\neq 4</m> then <m>x\neq 3</m>.</p>
<p>Before proving this statement, we note that it has logical form <m>(p\wedge q)\rightarrow r</m>. Since we are doing a proof by contradiction, we need to negate this statement. The negation has form <m>(p\wedge q) \wedge \neg r</m>. Thus, we will assume <m>p</m> is true, <m>q</m> is true, and <m>r</m> is false.</p>
<proof><p>By contradiction. We assume <m>x^2+y=13, y\neq 4</m> and <m>x=3</m>. Since <m>x=3</m> and  <m>x_2+y=13</m>, we get <m>9+y=13</m>. Thus, <m>y=4</m>. But this contradicts that <m>y\neq 4</m>.</p></proof>
</example>

<example xml:id="E_nogreatinteger"><title>There Is No Greatest Integer</title>
<p>Prove there is no greatest integer.</p>
<proof><p>By contradiction. Assume there is a greatest integer. Call this greatest integer <m>N</m>. Now consider <m>N+1</m>. Since <m>N</m> is an integer, <m>N+1</m> is an integer. We can see that <m>N+1>N</m>, which contradicts that <m>N</m> was the greatest. Therefore, there is no greatest integer.</p></proof>

<subsection xml:id="SS_contrapositive"><title>Proof by Contrapositive</title><idx><h>contrapositive</h><h>proof by</h></idx>

<p>Recall from <xref ref="connectives"/> the contrapositive of <m>p\rightarrow q</m> is <m>\neg q\rightarrow \neg p</m>. Also recall, that <m>p\rightarrow q</m> and <m>\neg q\rightarrow \neg p</m> are logically equivalent. This allows us to use the contrapositive in place of the original statement. Thus, a proof by contrapositive is just a direct proof of the contrapositive statement.</p>

<p>Since we can use either contradiction or contrapositive on statements of the form <m>p\rightarrow q</m>, the following comparison may be helpful.</p>

<subsection xml:id="SS_twoproofs"><title>Two Classical Proofs</title>

<p>We are now able to use contradiction and contrapositive to prove two classical theorems in mathematics.</p>

  <p>In <xref ref="A_n2evenneven" /> you used contrapositive to prove if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even. This statement is an important step in our first big theorem. We state it here formally as a lemma.</p>

<lemma xml:id="L_nsquaredeven"><statement>Let <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. If <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even.</statement></lemma>
<proof><p>We will prove this by contrapositive. Assume <m>n</m> is odd. Show <m>n^2</m> is odd. Since <m>n</m> is odd, <m>n=2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then 
<me>n^2=(2k+1)^2=4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1.</me>
Since <m>2k^2+2k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>n^2</m> is odd.
</p>
</proof>

<theorem xml:id="T_roottwoirrational"><statement><p><m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p></statement></theorem>

<proof><p>We will prove this by contradiction. Assume <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational. Then <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}</m> with <m>p, q\in\mathbb{Z}, q\neq 0</m>. We will additionally assume <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors. [Note, this additional assumption just makes the proof simpler. You should convince yourself that it is reasonable to add this assumption--that given any fraction, we can always reduce so <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors.]</p>
<p>Now, using algebra on the equation, 
  <md>
    <mrow>\sqrt{2}&amp;=\frac{p}{q}</mrow>
    <mrow>2&amp;=\frac{p^2}{q^2}</mrow>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=p^2.</mrow>
  </md>
  Since <m>q^2\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>p^2</m> must be even. Then by <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" />, <m>p</m> must be even.</p>
<p>Since <m>p</m> is even, <m>p=2k</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, we can substitute into the above equation.
<md>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=(2k)^2</mrow>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=4k^2</mrow>
    <mrow>q^2&amp;=2k^2.</mrow>
  </md>
Since <m>k^2\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>q^2</m> must be even. Then by <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" />, <m>q</m> must be even.</p>

<p>But now we have <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> both even, which means they both have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors. Since we reached a contradiction, we can conclude that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p>
</proof>

<p>Make sure you can read through the above proof and follow from one step to the next.</p>

<activity xml:id="A_squarediv3"><title>If the Square is Divisible by 3</title><introduction><p>In <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" /> and <xref ref="A_n2evenneven" />, we proved if <m>n^2</m> is even then <m>n</m> is even. Now suppose you want to prove if <m>n^2</m> is divisible by 3 then <m>n</m> is divisible by 3.</p></introduction>

<task><p>To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you show?</p></task>
<task><statement><p>The problem with now giving a direct proof of the contrapositive is that we need to know what we mean by <q><m>n</m> is not divisible by 3.</q> Recall the Division Algorithm, <xref ref="T_divisionalgorthm" />. If <m>n</m> is not divisible by 3, what are the possible forms for <m>n</m>? </p></statement><hint>Think of the forms for <m>n=3q+r</m>.</hint></task>
<task><p>Now write a proof by cases using the cases for <m>n</m> from (c) to show if <m>n</m> is not divisible by 3, then <m>n^2</m> is not divisible by 3.</p></task>
</activity>

<p>Our second classical theorem is to prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. In <xref ref="E_nogreatinteger"/> we proved there are infinitely many integers. In that proof, if we had a biggest integer, <m>N</m>, we were able to construct an integer that was greater than <m>N</m>, namely <m>N+1</m>. However, primes are not that nice. If you were to list out several prime numbers, it would be impossible to find a pattern for the next prime. Sometimes primes are close together, like 17 and 19, and sometimes they are far apart. In fact, it is possible to prove that we can find a list of <m>n</m> consecutive integers where none of the consecutive integers are prime for any positive integer <m>n</m>. This means there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive integers with no primes, or there are primes that are arbitrarily far apart.</p>

<p>First we need to understand a bit more about divisibilty with primes.</p>

<activity xml:id="A_divprimes"><title>Prime Divisor of <m>a+1</m></title><introduction><p>Consider the statement: for all <m>a\in \mathbb{Z}</m> and primes <m>p</m>, if <m>p\mid a</m> then <m>p \nmid (a+1)</m>.</p></introduction>

<task><p>If you were able to find a contradiction, try to write a careful proof by contradiction for the statement.</p></task>

</activity>

<p>The statement in <xref ref="A_divprimes"/> is an important lemma for proving there are infinitely many primes.</p>

<lemma xml:id="L_primedivplus1"><statement><p>For all <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and all primes <m>p</m>, if <m>p\mid n</m> then <m>p\nmid n+1</m>.</p></statement></lemma>
<proof><p>We will prove this by contradiction. Let <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>p</m> prime. Assume <m>p\mid n</m> and <m>p\mid n+1</m>. Since <m>p\mid n</m>, <m>n=pk</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Since <m>p\mid n+1</m>, <m>n+1=pj</m> for some <m>j\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, 
<md>
    <mrow>n+1&amp;=pj</mrow>
    <mrow>pk+1&amp;=pj</mrow>
    <mrow>1&amp;=pj-pk=p(k-j).</mrow>
  </md>
Since <m>k-j\in\mathbb{Z}, p\mid 1</m>, and <m>p</m> is a factor of 1. However, the only factors of 1 are 1 and -1, which are not prime. Thus, we have a contradiction.
</p>
</proof>

<theorem xml:id="T_infmanyprimes"><statement><p>There are infinitely many primes.</p></statement></theorem>
  
<proof><p>Assume there are finitely many primes. Since there are finitely many, we can list them all, say, <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n</m>. Now let <m>N=p_1\cdot p_2\cdot p_3\cdots p_n</m>, the product of all the primes. Consider <m>N+1</m>. We know <m>p_i\mid N</m> for each prime <m>p_i</m>. By <xref ref="L_primedivplus1"/>, <m>p_i\nmid N+1</m>. This means <m>N+1</m> is an integer greater than 1 with no prime divisor, which contradicts <xref ref="T_divbyprime" />.</p></proof>

    From <xref ref="ER_onlyandnot" /> we know that, given any statement of truth-functional logic, we can always find a logically equivalent statement that uses only the connectives <m>\neg</m> and <m>\wedge</m>.

    <p>Case 1: <m>\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}</m> is rational. Let <m>a=b=\sqrt{2}</m>. Then <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are irrational, and <m>a^b=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}</m>, which we assumed was rational.
  </p>
      <p>
    Case 2: <m>\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}</m> is irrational. Let <m>a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}</m> and <m>b=\sqrt{2}</m>. Then <m>a</m> is irrational by assumption, and we know that <m>b</m> is also irrational. Furthermore, <m>a^b=\bigl(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\bigr)^{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}^{(\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2})}=2</m>. Which is rational.
