<p>
This text is intended for a first course in proof-writing. The course builds fluency with proof techniques through examples from discrete math, number theory, and set theory. It emphasizes learning mathematical structure from logic and applying the strucure in a variety of contexts.</p>

<p>The material was developed for an Introduction to Proofs course at Linfield University. The course is currently taught as an intensive one month <q>January Term</q> course. The course is generally taken by math majors in their first year or two or by math minors who wish to improve their proof-writing ability.</p>

<p>There are no specific prerequisites besides some familariy with mathematical statements. The text assumes a familiarity with calculus, but only in that it references examples of statements from calculus. A background in calculus is not required for the content of the course.</p>

  <title>Course Goals</title>

<ul>
  <li> <p>To introduce basic mathematical terminology such as sets, functions, relations, and cardinality.</p></li>
  <li> <p>To introduce proof techniques such as direct proof, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and mathematical induction.</p></li>
  <li> <p>To develop proficiency in both reading and writing mathematical proofs.</p></li>
  <li> <p>To develop an understanding of logical structure.</p></li>
  <li> <p>To increase confidence in working through mathematical challenges.</p></li>
  <li> <p>To foster an appreciation and use of abstract reasoning.</p></li>

  <title>Course Format</title>

<p>The material is presented in a discovery format, requiring students to make conjectures frequently. Each section is structured as a class activity. Any introduction material can be read by the students, and the numbered problems or questions are to be out in class and as homework, depending on how far a particular student progresses through the section. Most sections require students to attempt to solve the problem <em>before</em> they have been provided much framework. The sections then build the necessary tools to solve the problem or understand the key ideas. Being able to compare their original solutions and ideas to the more sophisticated mathematical ones helps build their mathematical intuition and helps them to understand the power of using mathematics in situations where their intuition falls short.</p>

  <title>Suggestions for Use</title>

<p>
This text is primarily for use in a college-level quantitative reasoning course. It can also be used for an introductory course in game theory for the social sciences. It approaches the subject matter through an inquiry-based format.  Most of the topics can be introduced by providing the students with the activity to work through during class, followed by a discussion. Almost all of the activities are intended to work through the concepts without additional lecture or introduction. 
Students with even a rudimentary background in algebra will find the material accessible. Any necessary mathematical background can be introduced as needed. </p>
