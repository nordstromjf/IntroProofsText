  <introduction>
  <p>As we move into proving mathematical statements, we need to better understand the statements themselves. In your previous work with mathematics, you've often used variables and equations.</p>

  <p>Think of some examples of variables <idx>variable</idx> you've seen in other math classes. What do these variables represent? Probably, the first example that comes to mind is something from an algebra class, such as <m>y=x^2</m> or <m>f(x)=3x+2</m>. You may also think of examples such as solving for <m>x</m> in an expression such as <m>x^2=4</m>. We use variables in mathematical statements to represent quantities that can vary. But we also use them to be more precise. Think of how much more confusing the first statement would be if we had to write it as "a number squared equals another number;" or the second statement, "the function which multiplies a number by 3 and adds 2." When you first learned varables, you probably WERE introduced to them in terms of sentences, but eventually, you got used to what the symbols mean. </p>

  <p>In this class, we will rarely be interested in mathematical equations. We want to move to the common format of mathematical statements often found when describing mathematical defintions or theorems.</p>

  <p> Common forms of mathematical statements:
    <ul>
      <li><title>Universal Statements<idx>universal statement</idx></title> <p>We use these statements when a property is true for all things in a set.</p> <p>Example: Every math student takes Calculus.</p>
      </li>
      <li><title>Conditional Statements<idx>conditional statement</idx></title>  <p>These statements usually have the form <q>if...then...</q>. </p> <p>Example: If a student majors in Computer Science, then she takes Discrete Math.</p></li>
      <li><title>Existential Statements<idx>existential statement</idx></title> <p>We use these statements when somthing exists with a particular property.</p> <p>Example: There exists a Linfield class that meets at 9am on Mondays.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many mathematical statements use variables. For example, <m>x+3/2=4</m> is not a statement since it has no truth value. However, if we say, <q>there exists <m>x</m> such that <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> or <q>for all <m>x</m>, <m>x+3/2=4</m></q>, and we know what set <m>x</m> belongs to, then we can decide whether these statements are true or false. </p>

<!--<p>In order to determine whether a statement is true of false, we first need to know the domain.</p>

<definition><statement> <p>The <term>domain</term><idx>domain for a quantified statement</idx> for a quantified statement is the set of possible values for a variable in a quantified statement.</p></statement></definition>

  <example xml:id="E_domainqexist1"><title>Domain and Existential Statements</title>
    <p>Let <m>D=\mathbb{Z}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>there exists <m>x\in D</m> such that <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> is the only value satisfying the equation, but <m>x\notin \mathbb{Z}</m>, the statement is false.</p></answer>

    <p>Let <m>D=\mathbb{R}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>there exists <m>x\in D</m> such that <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> is the only value satisfying the equation, and <m>x\in \mathbb{R}</m>, the statement is true.</p></answer>

    <p>Let <m>D=\{5/2\}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>there exists <m>x\in D</m> such that <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> is the only value satisfying the equation, and <m>x\in D</m>, the statement is true.</p></answer>
  </example>

  <example xml:id="E_domainquniversal1"><title>Domain and Universal Statements</title>
    <p>Let <m>D=\mathbb{Z}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>for all <m>x\in D</m>, <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>

    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> satisfies the equation, and is the only value in <m>D</m>, the statement is true.</p></answer>
  </example>-->

  

  <p>We want to be able to work with generic statements, like <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>, but also with variables. So instead of <m>p</m>, we will use <m>P(x)</m>. An expression, <m>P(x)</m>, represents some property or expression about <m>x</m>. We call <m>P(x)</m> the <term>predicate</term><idx>predicate</idx>.</p>

  <example xml:id="E_predicates"><title>Statements with Variables</title>
    <p>Let <m>D=\mathbb{Z}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>for all <m>x\in D</m>, <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> is the only value satisfying the equation, certainly every integer does not satisfy the equation. The statement is false.</p></answer>

    <p>Let <m>D=\mathbb{R}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>for all <m>x\in D</m>, <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> is the only value satisfying the equation, certainly every real number does not satisfy the equation. The statement is false.</p></answer>

    <p>Let <m>D=\{5/2\}</m>. Determine whether the statement <q>for all <m>x\in D</m>, <m>x+3/2=4</m></q> is true or false.</p>
    <answer><p>Since <m>x=5/2</m> satisfies the equation, and is the only value in <m>D</m>, the statement is true.</p></answer>

  <p>In these examples, <m>P(x)</m> is <m>x+3/2=4</m>.</p>    
  </example>

  

  <p>Our properties don't just need to be mathematical, though. For example we could have a predicate such as <m>P(x)</m> is <q><m>x</m> is a math major.</q> In this case the set of possible values for <m>x</m> could be the set of students at Linfield, or the set of students in Introduction to Proofs. As we saw in <xref ref="E_predicates" />, it is important that we define our set of interest, as changing the set can change whether the statement is true or false.</p>

  <!--<p>One goal with quantified statements is to be able to decide when they are true.</p>

  <definition><statement> <p>The <term>truth set</term><idx>truth set for a predicate</idx> for a predicate, <m>P(x)</m>, is the set of values for <m>x</m> that make <m>P(x)</m> true.</p></statement></definition>

  <title>Negating Quantified Statements</title>

  <p>In this section we will look at how to negate statements involving quantifiers.</p>

  <!--<p>If you look back at the Check your Understanding questions in the previous section, <xref ref="quantifiersI3-1"/>, you should notice that both <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> and <m>\forall x\in D, \neg P(x)</m> were false, which means they are not negations of each other. Similarly, both <m>\exists x\in D, P(x)</m> and <m>\exists x \in D, \neg P(x)</m> were true. In general, the two statements won't necessarily have the same truth values, but the examples were chosen to make sure we can see that they are not negations of each other.</p>-->
<assemblage xml:id="B_negquantstatements">
  <title>Negations of Quantified Statements</title><idx><h>quantifier</h><h>negation</h></idx>
<p><ul>
  <li><p>The negation of <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> is <m>\exists x\in D, \neg P(x)</m>; or
   <me>\neg(\forall x\in D, P(x))\equiv \exists x\in D, \neg P(x).</me></p></li>
  <li><p>The negation of <m>\exists x\in D, P(x)</m> is <m>\forall x\in D, \neg P(x)</m>; or
  <me>\neg(\exists x\in D, P(x))\equiv \forall x\in D, \neg P(x).</me></p></li>
</ul></p>
</assemblage>

  <p>We can think of negation as switching the quantifier and negating <m>P(x)</m>, but it will be really helpful if we can understand WHY this is the negation. Thinking about negating a <q>for all</q> statement, we need the statement to not be true for all things, which means it must be false for something, Thus, there exists something making <m>\neg P(x)</m> true. Thinking about negating a <q>there exists</q> statement, we need there not to exist anything making <m>P(x)</m> true, which means <m>P(x)</m> must be false for everything. Thus, everything makes <m>\neg P(x)</m> true.</p>

  <example xml:id="E_negquant1"><title>Negating a Quantified Statement</title>
    <p>Negate the statement: For all primes <m>p</m>, <m>p</m> is odd. Is this statement true or false?</p>

    <p>Negate the statement: There exists a real number <m>x</m>, such that <m>x^2&lt; 0</m>. Is this statement true or false?</p>
    <answer><p>For all real numbers <m>x</m>, <m>x^2\geq 0</m>. The original statement is false, since the negation is true.</p></answer>

  <p>The relationship between <q>for all</q> and <q>there exists</q> can be used to show some surprising things. In particular, what happens if our domain, <m>D</m>, has nothing in it? Let <m>D=\emptyset</m>, the empty set. Is <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> true or false? Well, let's look at the negation: <m>\exists x\in D, \neg P(x)</m>. Now the negation MUST be false since <m>D</m> has nothing in it, so there can't exist something in <m>D</m> making <m>\neg P(x)</m> true. Since the negation is false, the original statement is true! We say <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> is <term>vacuously</term><idx>vacuously true statement</idx> true. </p>

<subsection xml:is="SS_multiquant"><title>Multiple Quantifiers</title>

  <p>Many statements in mathematics involve multple quantifiers. For example, <q>For all real numbers <m>x</m>, there exists a real number <m>y</m> with <m>x+y=0</m>.</q> These statements, though frequent in math courses, represent some of the most complicated types of statements to understand. In this section we will try to understand the general structure of such statements.</p>

<p>Let's look at the various ways we could have statements with two quantifiers. Since we have two quantifiers, we will have two variables. Thus, our predicate will now involve both variables. We can use the notation <m>P(x, y)</m> to mean a statement about <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><m>\forall x\in D, \exists y\in E, P(x, y)</m>.</p>
  <p>This means we can find a <m>y</m> in <m>E</m> that makes <m>P(x, y)</m> true for each <m>x</m> in <m>D</m>. In such statements <m>y</m> will often depend on <m>x</m>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><m>\exists x\in D, \forall y\in E, P(x, y)</m>.</p>
  <p>The order of the quantifiers matters. This means we can find a SINGLE <m>x</m> in <m>D</m> that makes <m>P(x, y)</m> true for every <m>y</m> in <m>E</m>. In such statements <m>x</m> does not depend on <m>y</m>. The same <m>x</m> must work for all the <m>y</m>'s.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><m>\forall x\in D, \forall y\in E, P(x, y)</m>.</p>
  <p>This means <m>P(x, y)</m> is true for all <m>x\in D</m> and for all <m>y\in E</m>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><m>\exists x\in D, \exists y\in E, P(x, y)</m>.</p>
  <p>This means <m>P(x, y)</m> is true for for at least one <m>x\in D</m> and at least one <m>y\in E</m>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <p>Although we won't study the mathematical context of the following example in this class, it is a classic example in mathematics of a statement with multiple quantifiers and a conditional. It is so important that it is the subject of one set of math bike racks in front of Taylor Hall!</p>

  <example xml:id="E_deflimit"><title>Definition of a Limit</title>
    <p>The definition of the limit of a function: For every <m>\epsilon>0</m>, there exists a <m>\delta>0</m> such that if <m>|x-a|&lt;\delta</m> then <m>|f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon</m>. Or in symbols, <me>\forall\epsilon>0, \exists\delta>0, |x-a|&lt;\delta\rightarrow |f(x)-L|&lt;\epsilon</me>.</p>
  </example>

  <p>Now, we want to be able to negate statements with multiple quantifiers. There is nothing really new here, we just negate our quantified statements as we did for single quantifiers.</p>
